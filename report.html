1. Git repository shared on github with hscientist.  I added you as a contributor.

2. This is the URL of the published site: https://sharemas.github.io/DAPProject2/#

3. report.html is accessible from the root.

4. Contains five separate pages, each having a meaningful purpose: index.html, login.html, featured.html, people.html, music.html. Pages link to each other in a logical and meaningful flow.

5. Site has a nav header.

6. Site has navigation links: the OurNet logo takes you home, and the featured, music, and people tab are navigatable.
The login button will take you to the login page. The functionality of the login page back to the site will be completed in phase 2.

<!------Not Done ------>
7. Your site must support distinct layouts for large and small screens using media queries. Use comments to note where you completed this activity. You may do this in a variety of ways. Consider using this to control images or switching blocks between rows (for large screens) and columns (for small).

8. Include images and alt attributes.

<!------Not Done ------>
8. Each page and stylesheet of your site must validate without any warnings or errors using the Nu Validator and WAVE Web Accessibility Evaluator.

10. My site uses font-family: Verdana, Tahoma, Times, serif; for the body and font-family: Arial, Verdana, Tahoma, Times, sans-serif; for the headings.

11. My site includes a search bar on every page in the top nav bar.

12. Each news article in the breaking news section will be linked to external news sources.



For project 2 -> probably would switch nav bars to bootstrap ones.
                probably would use a bootstrap login page for better functionality
                new post button will shop pop up for post or lead to another page to post.
