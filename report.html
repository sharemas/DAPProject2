1. Git repository shared on github with hscientist.  I added you as a contributor.

2. This is the URL of the published site: https://sharemas.github.io/DAPProject2/#

3. report.html is accessible from the root.

4. Contains five separate pages, each having a meaningful purpose: index.html, login.html, featured.html, people.html, music.html. Pages link to each other in a logical and meaningful flow.

5. Site has a nav header.

6. Site has navigation links: the OurNet logo takes you home, and the featured, music, and people tab are navigatable.
The login button will take you to the login page. The functionality of the login page back to the site will be completed in phase 2.


7. My site was initially built for laptop screens on a laptop screen which is the first layout. The second layout is for screens smaller than 514px (using media queries).
The next step for submission two is to implement a query for inbetween the large and small layouts (514 - 660);
Log in page does not currently need a media query. Perfectly fits the small layout

8. Included images and alt attributes on each page except for login.

<!------Not Done ------>
8. Each page and stylesheet of your site must validate without any warnings or errors using the Nu Validator and WAVE Web Accessibility Evaluator.

10. My site uses font-family: Verdana, Tahoma, Times, serif; for the body and font-family: Arial, Verdana, Tahoma, Times, sans-serif; for the headings.

11. My site includes a search bar on every page in the top nav bar and a new post option.

12. Currently, there is a link to external copyright information on the very bottom of the left nav bar.
In the future, each news article in the breaking news section will be linked to external news sources.




For project 2 -> probably would switch nav bars to bootstrap ones.
                --probably would use a bootstrap login page for better functionality
                --new post button will shop pop up for post or lead to another page to post.
                --- login on phone should be default page instead of having a button
